# The-Economic-Impact-of-Demographic-Dividend-A-Regional-Perspective-on-Growth-Dynamics

This study explores the regional dynamics of Indiaâ€™s demographic dividend, assessing the impact of the working-age population on per capita income growth across various states. It analyzes the relationship between Mean Years of Schooling (MYS), youth Not in Education, Employment, or Training (NEET), and Net State Domestic Product (NSDP). The research focuses on 12 selected states based on their median age and working-age population share: Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and West Bengal. The study uses growth rates of per capita income, worker productivity, employment rate, and the working-age population proportion from 2017-2020 to highlight regional trends and economic disparities. The report also emphasizes the importance of creating adequate employment opportunities to fully benefit from the demographic window of opportunity.
